Code for testing servo movements.

Expand to include multiple servos.

Document any pinouts below:
Joystick: GND-GND ; 5V-5V ; VRX-A0 ; VRY-A1 ; SEL-D6
Servo: GND-GND ; VCC-External Supply ; Sig-D3 ; Feedback-A6

Currently setting up joystick to map to servo movement, my joystick I was testing
seems to be broken, so I need to try one of the new ones.
