# Getting Started
## The GitHub Repository
First, be sure to download Git and GitBash from the following link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

GitBash provides a better terminal for git commands compared to the windows terminal.
I would recommend getting used to using the commands in the terminal over the desktop app
as it will be better in the long run.

Once Git and GitBash are downloaded, make a file somewhere on your computer and complete the following steps:
1. Open the file
2. Right click in the window and select 'GitBash here'
3. A GitBash terminal should open up with a file path to your folder
4. Go to the GitHub repository and go to 'Code' at the top right
5. Copy the HTTPS link it gives you
6. In the GitBash terminal, type the following (without brackets)
  > clone \<insert link here\>
7. This will clone the stuff on the GitHub repository onto your local machine
